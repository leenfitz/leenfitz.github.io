<p><strong>Ellen Fitzpatrick</strong> is a well known star in the Philadelphia area.  Scoring 994 points at Saint Joseph's, she was the point guard for a NCAA sweet 16 team.  Ellen is not only in the Saint Joseph's University Hall of Fame, but also the Philadelphia Big 5.  Being only 5'5", Ellen had to work extra hard on her skills to be the player that she had become.  With that being said, Ellen can help you be the best player you will ever be.  </p>
